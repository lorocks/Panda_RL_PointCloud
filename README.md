# RL Training for a Unified Framework for Robotic Radiotherapy Planning

This is a repo that trains an Reinforcement Learning agent using a robot in RViz where the enviornment is a rendering of a point cloud.
The observation is the 2D view of the point cloud taken from a camera attached on the robot end-effector.
